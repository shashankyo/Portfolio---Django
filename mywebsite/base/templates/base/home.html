					<h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<!-- <p>3 months after writing my first Hello World program on September 8th 2017 (While working in the marketing department) I had convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better version of the outdated laboratory management system my company was running on.</p>

					<p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine. My newbie self was now in charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p> -->

					<p>Copy and Practice</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>
